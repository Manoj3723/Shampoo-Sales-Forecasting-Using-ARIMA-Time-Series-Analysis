# Shampoo-Sales-Forecasting-Using-ARIMA-Time-Series-Analysis
Machine learning model to predict future sales of shampoo products using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time series analysis

## Introduction
Sales forecasting is a crucial task for any business as it helps in making informed decisions regarding inventory, marketing strategies, and financial planning.<br>
The goal of this project is to forecast future shampoo sales using historical sales data. The ARIMA model is employed due to its effectiveness in time series forecasting. The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing<br>
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
3. Time Series Decomposition<br>
4. Model Selection and Training<br>
5. Model Evaluation<br>
6. Forecasting<br>
7. Visualization<br>

## Dataset
The dataset contains monthly sales data for shampoo products. It includes the following columns:<br>

**Month:** The month of the sales data in YY-MM format.<br>
**Sales:** The sales figures for each month.<br>
**Sample data:**<br>

## Results
The results of the project include:<br>

1. A time series plot of historical sales data.<br>
2. Decomposition of the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.<br>
3. A trained ARIMA model for sales prediction.<br>
4. Evaluation metrics for the model's performance.<br>
5. Forecasted sales for future periods.<br>
